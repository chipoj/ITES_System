Amounts which are capital in nature are excluded from gross income 	 
There is a deemed disposal on receipt of the insurance payout. 	
The proceeds received from the insurance are not revenue in nature but capital in nature as the motor vehicle had an enduring benefit to Appollo. 	
Recoupment may need to be calculated as there may have been a recovery of capital allowances previously granted. 	1 
The motor vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle and the cost was within the limit of $100,000 for purposes of determining capital allowances. 	
Upon the deemed disposal the recoupment will only be limited to the capital allowances claimed.

Thus, Appollo shall not be allowed a deduction on the ZWL60,000 incurred in the acquisition of the desks.  	
However, the desks shall rank for capital allowances as per section 15(2)(c) 	 
The desks shall rank for SIA in 2020 when they are brought into use. 	","You did a commendable job identifying the key elements in the taxation surrounding the destruction of the motor vehicle and the purchase of desks. It's great to see that you recognized the importance of distinguishing capital from revenue in the context of insurance proceeds and capital allowances. Your explanation regarding the enduring benefit of both the motor vehicle and the desks is well articulated.

However, there are a few areas where you could refine your understanding and reasoning. While you correctly noted that the proceeds from the insurance payout are capital in nature, it’s essential to clarify that recoupment must not only consider the capital allowances previously granted but also any specific rules regarding the disposal process in tax law. 

You mentioned that the recoupment amount is limited to the capital allowances claimed, which is accurate. Just remember that the calculation should thoroughly reflect the specific circumstances of the disposal, including any applicable thresholds or limits beyond the amount you've cited.

Regarding the desks, you correctly identified that they are treated as capital in nature and will rank for capital allowances. Yet, ensure you’re clear on the timing of the capital allowances—while you stated that they will rank for SIA when they are brought into use, it’s beneficial to mention that the effective rates or deductions will apply based on the relevant taxation periods or any specific conditions that may affect their recognition.

Overall, you’re on the right path, and with additional attention to the nuances of recoupment and the specific details regarding allowances, you will strengthen your grasp of these taxing principles further. Don't hesitate to revisit these concepts or try similar questions to solidify your understanding.

This is because Appollo is registeed on the ZImbabawe stock exchange there means the compnay is from Zimbabawe.  Therefore the source if sales from SA are from Zimbabawe as it is deemed to be source from Zimbabwe. In terms of local source the location is Zimbabwe,"You did a commendable job identifying the key rule regarding the determination of the true source of income when operations span multiple jurisdictions. Your understanding that the location of the dominant activity is crucial is a strong point in your response.

However, there are several areas for improvement that align with the taxation rules. You mentioned that since Apollo is registered on the Zimbabwe stock exchange, the income is deemed to be sourced from Zimbabwe regardless of where the sales occur. While company registration does play a role in establishing jurisdiction, it is the actual business activities that significantly impact the source determination. 

In the correct solution, it is highlighted that both manufacturing in Zimbabwe and sales marketing in South Africa are considered. Since 60% of Apollo's sales are exported to South Africa, it's essential to analyze where the dominant activities occur. The correct conclusion is that even though sales are made in South Africa, if the significant manufacturing processes originate in Zimbabwe, then the true source of the income is Zimbabwe.

Be sure to carefully consider the complete operational context when determining income sources. The balance of activities in multiple jurisdictions can have a complex influence on where such income is sourced.

However, there are a few areas where you can improve. First, your explanation could benefit from clearer articulation of the taxation process. While you mentioned the reduced tax rate of 20%, it would greatly enhance your answer to explicitly state that this rate applies specifically to the taxable portion of the foreign dividend, as not all foreign dividends are taxed in the same manner depending on various factors, such as tax treaties and exemptions.

Also, when you stated the amount of ZWL15,500, you indicated this as part of the gross income but did not clarify that this figure should represent the gross amount of the dividend received, meaning it should be accurately stated as either gross or net income. Clarity around this distinction is vital in tax law.

To better align your answer with the taxation rules, ensure you clearly explain how the gross dividend received is the amount included in gross income and that it must be assessed against the relevant tax exemptions or treaties that may apply, which could possibly reduce the tax liability further.

It’s important to recognize that you engaged with the material, which is a positive step towards understanding these complex taxation rules.

However, there are some key areas where your answer could be improved. The primary issue lies in the misapplication of the taxation rules regarding the determination of the true source of income that involves multiple jurisdictions. According to the taxation rules, it's crucial to ascertain where the dominant activity related to the manufacturing or selling of the goods or services occurs. In this scenario, while you mentioned the residency of the taxpayer, the dominant activities taking place in the two jurisdictions (Zimbabwe and South Africa) need to be clearly analyzed.

In the example, the major manufacturing actions were occurring in Zimbabwe, while additional activities like marketing and customization were happening in South Africa. Therefore, it is the activities in Zimbabwe that define the true source of income for the transaction. Your conclusion should reflect that the dominant activity is essential when considering the source of the dividend, leading us to determine that the income is sourced from Zimbabwe.
