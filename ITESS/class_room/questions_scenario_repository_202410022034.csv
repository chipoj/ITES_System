Appollo set up a sales office in South Africa and eventually a workshop and warehouse where all the South African sales are packaged and sometimes customized as per customer needs. 60% of Appollo’s sales are exports to South Africa. 
In December 2023, Appollo lost a Mercedes Benz G wagon (3500cc) to an accidental fire which resulted sssin the vehicle being damaged beyond repair. The insurance paid ZWL52,000 for the vehicle which had initially cost Appollo ZWL45,000 to purchase in March of the previous year. ZWL60,000 was then used

Appollo Ltd Bulawayo branch is currently managed by Ms Dipuo Motse, a South African resident who was seconded to Zimbabwe in November 2021 for a period of three years. Dipuo’s salary is paid through the Bulawayo branch’s payroll while she is working there. 
Dipuo was involved in an accident at work in December 2022: she was run over by a forklift that was being driven by a fellow employee who was stacking boxes in Appollo’s warehouse.

Appollo is obliged to pay as the claim was made to them
